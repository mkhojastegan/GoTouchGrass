# GoTouchGrass
This is the winning project under the track "Go Touch Grass" for Idea Hacks 2024.

In a team of three, we developed this Arduino Uno project which combines the fun of video games
with the health advantages of fitness. Players move through a choose-your-own story adventure
trying to outrun fictional monsters, and must maintain a heartbeat threshold to continue the story.

This project was done in C/C++ compatible code utilizing multiple Arduino libraries.

## Building
This project works with the Arduino IDE 2.2.1

Note that building must be done with an Arduino IDE, compatible breadboard, soundboard, heartbeat
sensor, and generic buttons, as well as an SD card for loading tracks.
